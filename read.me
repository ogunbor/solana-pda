Since this is like a bank app, there would be 3 main features of the app:
-Create
-Deposit
-Withdraw

The Create function would be by just one person who 'created' the bank app in the first place.
It would be represented by the Pubkey of the creator.


The Deposit function would be open to all other individuals so they can deposit into the bank(vault)

The withdraw function would also be accessible by the owner only.
